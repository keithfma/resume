    \begin{cvitems}
      \item Lead engineer for synthetic farm event generation service, which constructs realistic agricultural histories for fields anywhere in the US. Applications include reducing customer data-entry burden without reducing carbon modeling accuracy, computing emissions for regional “supply sheds”, and supporting in-house research.
      \item Lead engineer for automated life-cycle-analysis (LCA) model that computes direct and indirect CO\textsubscript{2}-equivalent emissions per bushel grain harvested at the individual field level from farmer practice data – a critical component of Indigo’s carbon inventory products. Includes a novel pre-processing method for Monte Carlo uncertainty estimation that is ~100x faster than leading LCA tools.
      \item Core developer for soil carbon quantification system that estimates soil organic carbon as a function of farmer practices, weather, etc., for ~5.5M acres in the US, leading to >130k tons CO\textsubscript{2} sequestered so far. Responsible for automated data validation and remediation service that integrates the best available in-house and public reference data (e.g., ML inferences from satellite observations, USDA statistical reports, etc.) to flag data quality issues and resolve them automatically. 
      \item Designed and implemented tools for satellite imagery visualization and analysis, including a dynamic (on-demand) image tiling service for interactive visualization of the latest 20m/pixel resolution imagery in Indigo’s web applications with a 100ms response time.
      \item Build team performance and cohesion by mentoring junior engineers, sharing knowledge with peers, and collaborating with product and science on requirements, milestones, and prioritization
